    "- **age** - Age in years  \n",
    "- **sex** - (1 = male; 0 = female)  \n",
    "- **cp** - Chest pain type:  \n",
    "  - 0: Typical angina - chest pain related to decreased blood supply to the heart  \n",
    "  - 1: Atypical angina - chest pain not related to the heart  \n",
    "  - 2: Non-anginal pain - typically esophageal spasms (non-heart related)  \n",
    "  - 3: Asymptomatic - chest pain not showing signs of disease  \n",
    "- **trestbps** - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital). Anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern  \n",
    "- **chol** - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl  \n",
    "  - Serum = LDL + HDL + 0.2 * triglycerides  \n",
    "  - Above 200 is cause for concern  \n",
    "- **fbs** - (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)  \n",
    "  - '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes  \n",
    "- **restecg** - Resting electrocardiographic results:  \n",
    "  - 0: Nothing to note  \n",
    "  - 1: ST-T Wave abnormality (can range from mild symptoms to severe problems, signals non-normal heartbeat)  \n",
    "  - 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart's main pumping chamber)  \n",
    "- **thalach** - Maximum heart rate achieved  \n",
    "- **exang** - Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)  \n",
    "- **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (looks at stress of heart during exercise; unhealthy heart will stress more)  \n",
    "- **slope** - The slope of the peak exercise ST segment:  \n",
    "  - 0: Upsloping - better heart rate with exercise (uncommon)  \n",
    "  - 1: Flat sloping - minimal change (typical for a healthy heart)  \n",
    "  - 2: Downsloping - signs of an unhealthy heart  \n",
    "- **ca** - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy  \n",
    "  - Colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through  \n",
    "  - The more blood movement, the better (no clots)  \n",
    "- **thal** - Thallium stress result:  \n",
    "  - 1,3: Normal  \n",
    "  - 6: Fixed defect - used to be a defect but is now okay  \n",
    "  - 7: Reversible defect - no proper blood movement when exercising  \n",
    "- **target** - Indicates whether the patient has heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no) (= the predicted attribute)  "

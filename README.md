# Heart Disease ML Model

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on a dataset containing various patient health parameters. The goal is to analyze and interpret the model results to support medical diagnosis.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) and includes information such as:

- Patient age
- Gender
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Heart rate
- Presence of chest pain

## 🔍 Methods & Models

The project tests various ML models, such as:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The best model is selected based on metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 📈 Visualizations & Results

The project includes visual analyses of model results, including:

- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
